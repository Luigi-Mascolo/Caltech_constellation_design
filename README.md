Constellation Design - a quick overview

Disclaimer:
The code included in this repository provides a simplified, quick, yet effective approximation for generating periodic and repeating groundtracks. It is intended for educational and demonstrative purposes.

Please note that real mission design involves a significantly more complex dynamical environment, including multiple perturbations and operational constraints. As a result, for certain orbital configurations you might try with the provided code, the computed repeating groundtrack may not close perfectly, or may fail to close altogether.

This behavior is expected given the model’s intentional simplifications and should not be interpreted as a numerical or physical error.
